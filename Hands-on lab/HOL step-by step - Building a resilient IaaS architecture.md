# Building a resilient IaaS architecture hands-on lab step-by-step 

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this hands-on lab, you will deploy a pre-configured IaaS environment and then redesign and update it to account for resiliency and in general high availability. Throughout the hands-on lab you will use various configuration options and services to help build a resilient architecture.

At the end of the lab, you will be better able to design and use availability sets, Managed Disks, SQL Server Always on Availability Groups, as well as design principles when provisioning storage to VMs. In addition, you'll learn effective employment of Azure Backup to provide point-in-time recovery.

## Overview

Contoso has asked you to deploy their infrastructure in a resilient manner to insure their infrastructure will be available for their users and gain an SLA from Microsoft.

## Solution architecture

Highly resilient deployment of Active Directory Domain Controllers in Azure.

14. Once Azure notifies the network interface change is saved, repeat these steps on the remaining 3 DCs (**DC02**, **DC03**, and **DC04**).

    >**Note**: The Static IP for **DC02** should be 10.0.2.6. **DC03** should be 172.16.2.4 and **DC04** should be 172.16.2.5.

15. In the Azure portal, click **More Services \>** and in the filter, type in **Virtual Networks**. Select **VNET2** from the list.

16. In the **Settings** area, select **DNS Servers**.

    ![Under Settings, DNS servers is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image63.png "Settings section")

17. Change **DNS servers** to **Custom**, and provide the address of **10.0.2.4** in the **Add DNS server** box. Click the **Save** icon to commit the changes.

    ![In the DNS Servers blade, under DNS servers, the Custom radio button is selected, and the field below it is set to 10.0.2.4. ](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image64.png "DNS Servers blade")

18. At this point, restart **DC03** and **DC04**, so they can get their new DNS Settings.

    >**Note**: **DC01** and **DC02** received the correct DNS settings from the VNET DNS configured prior to their deployment, as the custom DNS was set before the hands-on lab for that VNET. **DC03** and **DC04** must be rebooted to receive the updated DNS settings from their virtual network.

19. While these two DCs are rebooting, RDP into **ADVM** using the credentials for **demouser**, and run the following PowerShell command:

    ```powershell
    Set-DnsServerPrimaryZone -Name contoso.com -DynamicUpdate NonsecureAndSecure
    ```

    >**Note**: This would not be done in a production environment, but for purposes of our hands-on lab, we need to perform this step for the SQL Cluster in the coming tasks.

20. After the PowerShell command runs, sign out of **ADVM**.

### Task 5: Promote DCs as additional domain controllers 

1.  Login to **LABVM** created before the hands-on lab or the machine where you have downloaded the exercise files.

2.  Browse to the Azure portal and authenticate at <https://portal.azure.com/>.

3.  Click on **DC01** on the Azure dashboard.

4.  In the **Settings** area, click **Extensions**.

    ![Under Settings, Extensions is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image65.png "Settings section")

5.  Click the **+ Add** icon.

    ![Screenshot of the Add icon.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image66.png "Add icon")

6.  Choose **Custom Script Extension** by Microsoft Corp., and click the **Create** button to continue.

    ![The Custom Script Extention option displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image67.png "Custom Script Extention option")

7.  Browse to the **C:\\HOL** folder and select the **AddDC.ps1** script by clicking the folder icon for **Script file (Required)**. Then, click the **OK** button to continue.

    ![The Script file field is set to AddDC.ps1, and the OK button is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image68.png "Script section")

8.  This script will run the commands to add this DC to the domain as an additional DC in the contoso.com domain. Repeat these steps for **DC02**, **DC03**, and **DC04**.

9.  Once this succeeds, you will see a **Provisioning succeeded** message under **Extensions** for all four domain controllers.

    ![In the Extensions blade, the status for CustomScriptExtensions is Provisioning succeeded.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image69.png "Extensions blade")

    >**Note**: If this were a live production environment, there would need to be some additional steps to clean up Region 1 and to configure DNS, Sites and Services, Subnets, etc. Please refer to documentation on running Active Directory Virtualized or in Azure for details. ADVM should be demoted gracefully, and if required, a new DC can be added to the ADAV Availability Set and data disk attached for F:\\.

10. Open the settings for **VNET2** in the Azure portal. Under DNS servers, remove the exiting custom DNS entry and add the two new domain controller IP addresses and click **Save**.

    - DNS servers
        - **172.16.2.4**
        - **172.16.2.5**

    ![A screen that shows setting the IP addresses for the two new DNS servers on the virtual network.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image70.png "DNS servers")

    >**Note**: It could take up to 30 minutes to deploy the environment.

### Summary

In this exercise, you deployed resilient web servers behind a load balancer, and a SQL Always-On Availability Group for database resiliency through an ARM template. Also, you deployed resilient web tier with an external load balancer through an ARM template.

## Exercise 4: Configure SQL Server Managed Backup 

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you will configure SQL Server Managed Backup to back up to an Azure Storage Account.

### Task 1: Create an Azure Storage Account

In this task, you will add a 3rd node to the SQL Always-On deployment in a second region that you can then failover with Azure Site Recovery in the event of a failure in the primary region.

1.  From **LABVM**, execute the following PowerShell commands in the PowerShell ISE to create a new storage account and generate the T-SQL needed to configure managed backup for the AdventureWorks database.

    ```powershell
    $storageAcctName = "[unique storage account name]"

    $resourceGroupName = "CloudShopRG"
    $containerName= "backups"
    $location = "East US 2"
    $storageSkuName = "Standard_LRS"

    "Creating Storage Account $storageAcctName"
    $sa = New-AzureRmStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName  `
        -Name $storageAcctName `
        -Location $location `
        -SkuName $storageSkuName 

    $storageKey = (Get-AzureRmStorageAccountKey -Name $storageAcctName -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName )[0].Value
    $context = New-AzureStorageContext -StorageAccountName $storageAcctName -StorageAccountKey $storageKey

    Write-Host "Creating New Storage Container  $containerName" 
    New-AzureStorageContainer -name $containerName -permission container -context $context

    $fullSasToken = New-AzureStorageContainerSASToken -Name $containerName -Permission rwdl -FullUri -Context $context  
    $containerUrl = $fullSasToken.Substring(0,$fullSasToken.IndexOf("?"))
    $sasToken = $fullSasToken.Substring($fullSasToken.IndexOf("?")+1)

    $enableManagedBackupScript = @"
    --------------------
    ---BEGIN TSQL Script
    --------------------
    CREATE CREDENTIAL [$containerUrl] 
    WITH IDENTITY = 'Shared Access Signature', 
         SECRET = '$sasToken' 

    GO

    EXEC msdb.managed_backup.sp_backup_config_basic   
     @enable_backup = 1,   
     @database_name = 'AdventureWorks',  
     @container_url = '$containerUrl',   
     @retention_days = 30
       
     --------------------
     ---END TSQL Script
     --------------------
    "@

    Write-Host $enableManagedBackupScript 
    ```

2.  Execute the code using PowerShell ISE. Make sure you change the **\$storageAcctName = \"\[unique storage account name\]\"** field to a unique storage account name across Azure prior to execution. 

3.  Save the T-SQL code generated between the **Begin TSQL Script** and **End TSQL Script** in your PowerShell ISE output after execution into a notepad file. This code creates an identity using a Shared Access Signature (SAS) to a container in the storage account and configures managed backup when executed.

### Task 2: Configure managed backup in SQL Server

1.  Connect to **SQL0** using remote desktop and launch SQL Server Management Studio and connect to the database instance.

2.  Right click on **SQL0**, and click **New Query**.

    ![A screen showing how to launch the new query pane in SQL Server Management Studio.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image102.png "Launching the new query pane")

3.  Paste in the following code and click **Execute** to enable SQL Server Agent extended stored procedures. Refresh SQL Server Management Studio and if SQL Server Agent is stopped right click on it and click Start.

    ```sql
    EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1
    GO
    RECONFIGURE
    GO
    EXEC sp_configure 'Agent XPs', 1
    GO
    RECONFIGURE
    GO
    ```

4.  Paste the T-SQL code you copied in the previous task into the query window replacing the existing code and click **Execute**. This code creates the new SQL identity with a Shared Access Signature for your storage account. 

5.  Paste the code into the query window replacing the existing code and click **Execute** to create a custom backup schedule.

    ```sql
    USE msdb;  
    GO  
    EXEC managed_backup.sp_backup_config_schedule   
         @database_name =  'AdventureWorks'  
        ,@scheduling_option = 'Custom'  
        ,@full_backup_freq_type = 'Weekly'  
        ,@days_of_week = 'Monday'  
        ,@backup_begin_time =  '17:30'  
        ,@backup_duration = '02:00'  
        ,@log_backup_freq = '00:05'  
    GO
    ```
6.  Execute the following tSQL in the query window to generate a backup on-demand. You can also specify Log for \@type.

    ```sql
    EXEC msdb.managed_backup.sp_backup_on_demand   
    @database_name  = 'AdventureWorks',
    @type ='Database'
    ```
    
## Exercise 5: Validate resiliency

### Task 1: Validate resiliency for the CloudShop application 

1.  In the Azure portal, open the **CloudShopRG** resource group. Click the Load Balancer, **OPSLB**.

2.  Click the **Overview** tab and copy the public IP address to the clipboard, and navigate to it in a different browser tab.

3.  After the application is loaded, click the Spike CPU button to simulate an auto scale event.

    ![A screen that shows the web page that allows for spiking the CPU,.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image105.png "CPU Spike Demo")

4.  After 15-20 minutes, refresh the browser and you will see cloud shop site is running and switched from one web server to another one. 

### Task 2: Validate SQL Always On

1.  Within the Azure portal, click on Virtual Machines and open **SQL0** Click **Stop** at the top of the blade to shut the virtual machine off.

2.  After the VM is deallocated, refresh the CloudShop application in your browser. If the page loads with data in the dropdown list SQL has successfully failed over the primary node to the secondary. You can login to the secondary VM (SQL1) and connect via SQL Server Management Studio to confirm.

### Task 3: Validate backups are taken 

1.  In the Azure portal, click All Services and search for Recovery Vault. Click the link and you should see the two recovery vaults created as part of the deployment of the Active Directory domain controllers.

2.  Open each vault and validate that a backup of the VM has occurred.

    ![The screen shows 2 backup items from one of the vaults.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image109.png "Usage")

    >**Note**: Backup storage consumption may be 0 B if a backup has not occurred. The timing of backups is driven by the policy associated with the backup. Only one policy can be assigned to a virtual machine when using the Azure Backup Extension for Virtual Machines.

3.  To validate the SQL Server backup, open the Storage Account created earlier in the Azure portal and click **Blobs** -\> and then **backups**. If the backup has already completed, you will see the backup file in the container.

    ![An image that depicts SQL Server backup data in an Azure Storage Account.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image110.png "Backup files in storage")

## Exercise 6: Implementing Azure Site Recovery 

### Task 1: Configure ASR Protection for Cloud Shop

1. In the Azure Portal - Resource Group - BackupVault2RG and open the BackupVault2.
   
2. In the **BackupVault2** blade, click on **Site Recovery** under **GETTING STARTED**.
   
3. Under **FOR ON-PREMISES MACHINES AND AZURE VMS** click **Step 1: Replicate Application**.

    ![An image that depicts Azure Site Recovery. An arrow points to Step 1: Replicate Application.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image03.png "Replicate application Settings")

4. On Step 1 Source, under Source Location choose the azure region where your Cloud Shop deployment exists. Then under Source resource group select the resource group where your Cloud Shop deployment exists (e.g. "CloudShopRG"). Select **Resource Manager** as Azure VM Deployment Model. Click OK.

    ![An image that depicts Azure Site Recovery settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image04.png "ASR replicate source settings")

5. On Step 2, Select the Virtual Machines (Web and SQL Servers) for the replication.

6. On the Configure settings blade, notice that you can alter the target resource group and virtual network settings, along with the replication policy. Click **Create target resources**. 

    >**Note**: Do not close the blade. It will close by itself after the target resources are created (2-3 minutes).

7. Several Site Recovery jobs will be initiated which are creating the replication policy as well as the target resources to be used during a failover. 

8. If you click on the Enable replication job, you can see additional details of what takes place when protecting a VM. It may take up to 30 minutes to complete the job. You can review it under Monitoring - Site Recovery Jobs at the Recovery Services Vault BackupVault2 blade. 
   
    ![An image that depicts Azure Site Recovery settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image05.png "ASR replicate source settings")

9. Once all the Enable replication jobs are successful, click on **Replicated items** under **Protected Items** to view the status of the initial replication.
    
10. While waiting for the initial replication/synchronization, move on to the next task.

### Task 2: Creating the Recovery Plan

In this task, you will create the recovery plan that will be used to orchestrate failover actions, such as the order in which failed-over VMs are powered on.

1. Within the properties of the Recovery Services vault, click on **Recovery Plans (Site Recovery)** under Manage. Click on Step 2: Manage Recovery Plans.

    ![An image that depicts Azure Recovery Plan for Site Recovery.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image06.png "ASR Recovery Plan")

2. On the Create recovery plan blade enter the name CloudShopRP. In the Source area select the region where you deployed Cloud Shop. The Target will be automatically selected. Under Allow items with deployment model, select Resource Manager. Click Select items and select the Virtual Machines. Click OK and, back on the Create recovery plan blade, click OK.

    ![An image that depicts Azure Recovery Plan Settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image07.png "ASR Recovery Plan settings")

3. After a minute or two, you should see the CloudShopRP on the Recovery plans blade. This recovery plan would bring up both servers at once during a failover. In an N-tier application, it is often best to have the data tier come up first. So, we will edit the recovery plan to accomplish this. Click the CloudShopRP recovery plan.
   
4. On the CloudShopRP blade click Customize. Within the Recovery plan blade, click + Group.

    ![An image that depicts Azure Recovery Plan Settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image08.png "ASR Recovery Plan settings")

5. Under Group 1: Start click on the ellipse beside WebVM-1 and WebVM-2 and choose Delete machine. Leave only SQL Server in Group-1.


6. Click on the ellipse beside Group 2: Start and choose Add protected item and Add Both Web servers. Then save the changes.

    ![An image that depicts Azure Recovery Plan Group Settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image09.png "ASR Recovery Plan Group settings")

7. Now go back to the Recovery Services Vault BackupVault2 - Overview blade. Click on Site Recovery. Notice the two servers that make the Cloud Shop application are replicating. Take note of their status. They should be close to 100%. You will not be able to continue until they are finished replicating. 
   
   >**Note**: This may take up to an hour.

### Task 3: Creating the Test Fail Over.

1. Within the Azure portal, click on Resource Groups and locate the resource group with -asr added to the end of its name.
   
    ![An image that depicts Azure Resource Group.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image10.png "ASR Resource Group")

2. Click on this resource group and notice the resources created by ASR to support workload protection and failover.

3. Navigate back to the Overview section of your Recovery Services vault via the tile on your dashboard. Under Site Recovery, click on **Replicated items** and ENSURE both Cloud Shop VMs are fully protected before continuing.
   
4. Navigate back to the Overview section of the **Recovery Services Vault**. Under Site Recovery click on **Recovery Plans**.

    ![An image that depicts Azure ASR Recovery Plan.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image12.png "ASR Recovery plan")

5. Right-click the CloudShopRP and click **Test Failover**.

    ![An image that depicts Azure ASR Recovery Plan.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image13.png "ASR Test failover")

6. On the new Test failover blade, under Choose a recovery point, select Latest processed (low RTO) and under Azure virtual network choose **CloudShopVNET1-asr**. Click OK.

>**Note**: In a 'real-world' recovery test, you should choose an isolated virtual network so as to not impact the production application. 

7. From the Recovery Services vault blade, click Jobs under MONITORING AND REPORTS. In the new blade, under General, select **Site recovery jobs**.
On the Site recovery jobs blade click on the running job (Test failover).

8. On the Test failover blade, monitor the progress of the failover. Notice each step is executing and you can track the status and execution time. Also notice that the data tier is being started first, then the app tier, as per our recovery plan.

9. Navigate back to the Overview section of the **Recovery Services Vault**. Under Site Recovery click back on Recovery plans. Notice the Recovery plan is waiting on your input.


10. Under Resource groups in the left-hand navigation bar, navigate to the resource group created for this protected workload, called CloudShopRG1-asr. Note the resources that have been created as a part of the failover action. The compute resources were not provisioned until the failover occurred.

### Task 4: Cleaning the Test Fail Over.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate back to the **Recovery Services Vault** via the dashboard tile. In the **Overview** section of the Recovery Services Vault, under the **Site Recovery tab**, click on **Recovery plans**.
